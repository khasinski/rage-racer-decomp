 * HANDWRITTEN_ASM - excluded from progress (see docs/ASM_AND_GTE_POLICY.md).
 *
 * Symbol:   D_80064554  (0x54D54, 13 words)
 * Reason:   a mutable data word embedded in .text immediately followed by the
 *           function code that reads/writes it via its own absolute address
 *           (t0 = 0x80064554; lw/sw 0(t0)). The leading word (init 0x00FFFFFF)
 *           lives inside the code section, before the routine.
 * Evidence: standard C cannot place a mutable global inline in .text ahead of a
 *           function (globals go to .data/.sdata/.bss, const to .rodata - never
 *           interleaved with code). The self-referential absolute load/store of
 *           its own symbol address confirms a hand-assembled data+code block.
 * C view:   not expressible as compiler C; effectively `static s32 state =
 *           0x00FFFFFF;` plus a small accessor, but the .text layout is not
 *           reproducible by GCC.
 * Revisit:  only if a linker/section arrangement can reproduce the exact layout.
